Epitalon, a naturally occurring tetrapeptide, is known for its anti-aging effects on mammalian cells. This happens through the induction of telomerase enzyme activity, resulting in the extension of telomere length. A strong link exists between telomere length and aging-related diseases. Therefore, telomeres are considered to be one of the biomarkers of aging, and increasing or maintaining telomere length may contribute to healthy aging and longevity. Epitalon has been the subject of several anti-aging studies however, quantitative data on the biomolecular pathway leading to telomere length increase, hTERT mRNA expression, telomerase enzyme activity, and ALT activation have not been extensively studied in different cell types. In this article, the breast cancer cell lines 21NT, BT474, and normal epithelial and fibroblast cells were treated with epitalon then DNA, RNA, and proteins were extracted. qPCR and Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated dose-dependent telomere length extension in normal cells through hTERT and telomerase upregulation. In cancer cells, significant telomere length extension also occurred through ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) activation. Only a minor increase in ALT activity was observed in Normal cells, thereby showing that it was specific to cancer cells. Our data suggests that epitalon can extend telomere length in normal healthy mammalian cells through the upregulation of hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase enzyme activity.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of vision loss. Short peptides, such as di-, tri-, and tetrapeptides, have various beneficial activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the antioxidant effect of the synthetic tetrapeptide AEDG (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly, Epitalon) improves the delayed healing process associated with hyperglycemia in DR, using a high glucose (HG)-injured human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19). We found that HG exposure delayed wound healing in ARPE-19 cells and increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while decreasing antioxidant gene expression. HG also induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and upregulated fibrosis-related genes, suggesting that HG-induced EMT contributes to subretinal fibrosis, the end-stage of eye diseases, including proliferative DR. The antioxidant Epitalon restored impaired wound healing in HG-injured ARPE-19 cells by inhibiting hyperglycemia-induced EMT and fibrosis. These findings support using the antioxidant agent Epitalon as a promising therapeutic strategy for DR to improve retinal wound healing compromised by hyperglycemia. More mechanistic investigations are needed to confirm Epitalon's benefits and safety. Developing ophthalmic forms of Epitalon may enhance its delivery directly to the retina, potentially improving its therapeutic efficacy.
