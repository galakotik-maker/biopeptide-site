Aging is a complex biological process characterized by the gradual deterioration of cellular functions, leading to an increased susceptibility to chronic diseases. In the search for interventions to promote healthy aging and extend lifespan, Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide/Nicotinamide Riboside (NMN/NR) have emerged as promising anti-aging agents. PQQ exerts its anti-aging effect primarily through enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, exerting antioxidant activity, and modulating inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, NMN/NR act as key precursors in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a crucial coenzyme involved in energy metabolism, cellular homeostasis, and DNA repair, thereby promoting longevity. This review systematically compares the mechanisms of action and efficacy of those compounds in mitigating age-related complications. Furthermore, this emphasizes the potent synergistic effect when PQQ and NMN/NR are used in combined formulations, highlighting their complementary pathways to support healthy aging. Despite supporting preliminary data and patented formulations, strong scientific evidence encouraging the synergistic anti-aging potential of PQQ and NMN/NR remains limited, highlighting the need for robust studies. Collectively, PQQ and NMN/NR offer distinct complementary strategies to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases; their combination could offer a more effective approach to enhance healthy aging and longevity.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential for many enzymatic reactions, including those involved in energy metabolism, DNA repair and the activity of sirtuins, a family of defensive deacylases. During aging, levels of NAD
