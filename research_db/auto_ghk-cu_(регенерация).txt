Copper-dependent proteins (such as lysyl oxidase, LOX) require copper acquisition within the Golgi apparatus to achieve enzymatic activation, and insufficient activation of these proteins is a key factor limiting fascia regeneration. To address this issue, this study, for the first time, proposes and validates a Golgi-targeted copper delivery system (LNP-ATOX1/GHK-Cu@PCL-GelMA). In this system, GHK-Cu serves as a stable copper source to provide a sustained release of Cu ions for cellular uptake, while lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are used to deliver mRNA encoding the copper chaperone ATOX1. Upregulation of ATOX1 facilitates the transport of copper into the Golgi apparatus via ATP7A/B, thereby enhancing the activity of copper-dependent proteins. In addition, ATOX1 promotes the copper-dependent translocation of ATP7A and Rac1 to the plasma membrane, synergistically accelerating neovascularization. In vitro studies demonstrated that this material system significantly increased copper accumulation within the Golgi apparatus, elevated LOX activity to 1.78 times that of the control group, and enhanced angiogenic capacity. In a rabbit fascia defect model, this strategy effectively promoted collagen alignment and neovascularization, improving extracellular matrix reconstruction and facilitating fascia regeneration. In conclusion, this work establishes a novel Golgi-targeted copper delivery strategy, providing a practical therapeutic approach for regenerative disorders caused by insufficient activation of copper-dependent proteins, such as fascia defects.

With the wide application of soft tissue fillers, implant material-induced inflammatory reactions have become a key factor affecting the therapeutic efficacy. This study developed an injectable filler with enhanced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by adsorbing glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine copper complex (GHK-Cu) onto hydroxyapatite microspheres (HAPs), marking the first combination of HAPs and GHK-Cu to address inflammation caused by soft tissue fillers. GHK-Cu was successfully loaded onto HAPs by electrostatic adsorption. HAPs were then mixed with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), glycerol (GLY), and water to form GHK-Cu@CMHA gel. The study focus on the effective combination of HAPs as a carrier for sustained GHK-Cu delivery and the anti-inflammatory properties of GHK-Cu. GHK-Cu@CMHA exhibits sustained release properties for 7 days, which ensures prolonged therapeutic effects, minimizes peptide waste and reduces injection frequency, with good flowability and injectability. In the model of LPS-induced inflammation model in vivo and in vitro, GHK-Cu@CMHA gel reduced levels of inflammatory factors and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels decreased, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was enhanced. In this process, H&E staining and Masson staining revealed significant collagen deposition. These findings further confirm that GHK-Cu@CMHA is a novel injectable soft tissue filler with good anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which holds well potential for inflammation inhibition.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by mucosal damage and impaired epithelial barrier function. While glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine-copper (GHK-Cu) exhibits known anti-inflammatory properties, its therapeutic mechanisms in UC remain undefined. This study was designed to systematically evaluate the therapeutic potential of GHK-Cu in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine model of UC, with particular emphasis on elucidating its regulatory effects on the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. UC was induced in BALB/c mice with 3% DSS for 14 days. The protein expression levels of tight junction associated protein-1 (ZO-1), Occludin, inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, SIRT1, STAT3, p-STAT3, and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) were detected by Western blot. Histopathological changes were evaluated by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS). Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to predict the core targets of GHK Cu in the treatment of UC. An in vitro UC model was also established in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and a co culture model was constructed using mouse colonic epithelial cells (MCECs) and MPMs to examine the role of GHK Cu in promoting mucosal healing. STAT3 was silenced by gene transfection technology to verify the core role of STAT3 in GHK Cu treatment of UC. GHK-Cu alleviated weight loss, improved the disease activity index (DAI), reduced colonic edema and shortening, attenuated inflammatory damage, increased goblet cell numbers, suppressed inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and promoted mucosal repair. Additionally, a co-culture system of MCECs and MPMs revealed that GHK-Cu facilitated MCECs healing, impaired by DSS, by upregulating ZO-1 and Occludin expression. Subsequently, network pharmacology and molecular docking identified SIRT1 as a potential target of GHK-Cu. Results showed that GHK-Cu upregulated SIRT1 protein expression and suppressed the expression of phosphorylated p-STAT3 in colon tissue and MCECs of the co-culture model. Our findings revealed that after transfection with STAT3-targeting siRNA (siSTAT3), the stimulant effect of GHK-Cu on the healing of MCECs and the effect on the protein expression of ZO-1 and Occludin is canceled. Nevertheless, after transfection with siSTAT3, it could inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors in conjunction with GHK-Cu. Furthermore, we found that GHK-Cu could inhibit RORγt expression in the colon tissue of UC mice. This study found that GHK-Cu demonstrated significant therapeutic effects in DSS-induced UC in mice. GHK-Cu may promote mucosal healing and enhance tight junction protein expression by regulating the SIRT1/STAT3 pathway. In addition to suppressing p-STAT3 expression, GHK-Cu may utilize additional pathways to inhibit inflammatory factors. Furthermore, GHK-Cu may reduce the number of Th17 cells. In summary, GHK-Cu may treat UC by acting on the SIRT1/STAT3 pathway.
