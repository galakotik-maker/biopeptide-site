Most first-line pharmacotherapeutic strategies for depression aim to boost serotonin and norepinephrine levels. However, 35% of patients with depression do not respond adequately to these treatments or experience adverse side effects. The serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, also known as triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs), are emerging as promising antidepressants with greater potency and fewer side effects. Here, we determine an ensemble of structures of DAT in complex with five distinct TRIs. Tesofensine and dasotraline stabilize DAT in an outward-facing conformation, while centanafadine, ansofaxine, and nefazodone capture the inward-facing conformation. These structures reveal binding poses and interactions involved in the association of inhibitors. Notably, ansofaxine binds at a location which is much closer to the intracellular membrane surface. Through extensive structural analysis, we establish a comprehensive blueprint for the association of these TRIs, which is crucial for future drug development aimed at achieving potent antidepressant with fewer side effect.

This study investigated the sex-specific effects of commonly prescribed appetite suppressants on body weight and the manifestation of motor side effects, specifically stereotypy. Employing video recordings and DeepLabCut (DLC) for precise behavioral quantification, we analyzed stereotypy, defined as purposeless, repetitive motor behaviors, in male and female rats. Under control (saline) conditions, male rats exhibited a greater propensity for weight gain compared to females. However, in contrast, female rats demonstrated greater and more homogenous weight loss than males following the administration of diethylpropion and tesofensine. Phentermine and mazindol induced comparable weight loss in both sexes, whereas cathine elicited weight reduction exclusively in males. 5-HTP and d-amphetamine administration only prevented weight gain relative to controls. Analysis of motor side effects revealed that drugs primarily targeting dopamine pathways - specifically, phentermine, mazindol, diethylpropion, cathine, and d-amphetamine - induced pronounced stereotypies, particularly head-weaving, in both sexes. Interestingly, tesofensine elicited head-weaving behavior exclusively in female subjects, albeit to a lesser extent than that observed with other dopaminergic agents; conversely, tesofensine was most frequently associated with orolingual dyskinesia. Male subjects treated with these same drugs exhibited an unexpected effect: spontaneous ejaculations, potentially attributable to the combined effects on dopamine and serotonin signaling in brain regions regulating sexual function. Network analysis and Markov transition matrices revealed distinct behavioral profiles associated with head-weaving, which emerged as the dominant attractor state, suggesting potential mechanistic differences among these drugs. Collectively, this study provides a valuable database characterizing the behavioral side effects of appetite suppressants.

Obesity is a major global health epidemic that has adverse effects on both the people affected as well as the cost to society. Several anti-obesity drugs that target GLP-1 receptors have recently come to the market. Here, we describe the effects of tesofensine, a novel anti-obesity drug that acts as a triple monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor. Using various techniques, we investigated its effects on weight loss and underlying neuronal mechanisms in mice and rats. These include behavioral tasks, DeepLabCut videotaped analysis, electrophysiological ensemble recordings, optogenetic activation, and chemogenetic silencing of GABAergic neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH). We found that tesofensine induces a greater weight loss in obese rats than lean rats, while differentially modulating the neuronal ensembles and population activity in LH. In Vgat-ChR2 and Vgat-IRES-cre transgenic mice, we found for the first time that tesofensine inhibited a subset of LH GABAergic neurons, reducing their ability to promote feeding behavior, and chemogenetically silencing them enhanced tesofensine's food-suppressing effects. Unlike phentermine, a dopaminergic appetite suppressant, tesofensine causes few, if any, head-weaving stereotypy at therapeutic doses. Most importantly, we found that tesofensine prolonged the weight loss induced by 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor, and blocked the body weight rebound that often occurs after weight loss. Behavioral studies on rats with the tastant sucrose indicated that tesofensine's appetite suppressant effects are independent of taste aversion and do not directly affect the perception of sweetness or palatability of sucrose. In summary, our data provide new insights into the effects of tesofensine on weight loss and the underlying neuronal mechanisms, suggesting that tesofensine may be an effective treatment for obesity and that it may be a valuable adjunct to other appetite suppressants to prevent body weight rebound.
